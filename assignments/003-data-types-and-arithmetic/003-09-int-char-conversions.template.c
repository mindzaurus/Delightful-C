/*
  UNDERSTANDING WIDENING AND NARROWING CONVERSIONS

  Use this template to complete this exercise

  1) declare a int variable mxint and set it to its max value,
  2) also declare another variable tmp_int and set it to 0
  3) declare a char variable mxchar and set it to its max value,
  4) also declare another variable tmp_char and set it to 0

  5) assign the value of mxchar to tmp_int and print the value
     this is an example of widening conversion you will observe no loss
  6) assign the value of mxint to tmp_char and print the value
     this is an example of narrowing conversion, you will observe value loss

  ************************************************************
  YOU CAN TRY THIS WITH UNSIGNED INT AND UNSIGNED CHAR AS WELL

  // Widening conversion no loss
  // 5) assign the value of mxchar to tmp_int and print the value of tmp_int


  // Narrowing conversion original value will be lost
  // 6) assign the value of mxint to tmp_char and print the value of tmp_char
