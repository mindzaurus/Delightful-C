/*
  UNDERSTANDING IF STATEMENT IN - QUICK MULTIPLY FUNCTION

  1) Write a function if_multiplier which takes in two int arguments x and y
     it should return an int value
  2) Function if_multiplier should check whether x is 1, if x is 1 then return y
     This is because y * 1 is y
  3) if x is not 1 then return x * y
  4) Call the if_multiplier with x as 3 and y as 2 from inside main function
     Store the the returned value in int variable result
  5) Print the variable result this should be 6
  6) Call the if_multiplier with x as 1 and y as 2 from inside main function
     Store the the returned value in int variable result
  7) Print the variable result this should be 2

  The important idea to understand if x is equal to 1
  then we don't do any multiplication as the if check is performed

  STEP 2) IS THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PROGRAM
*/

/*
  Output shall look like This
  3 * 2 result = 6
  if_multiplier: x == 1 so returning y directly no multiplication
  1 * 2 result = 2
