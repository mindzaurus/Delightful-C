  UNDERSTANDING SUBTRACTION OPERATOR IN C - THE CITY BOOK STORE

  Use this template to complete this exercise

  PART ONE
  ========
  1) Declare a int variable total_comics_count and assign a value of 128
  2) Declare a int variable children_comics_count and assign a value of 54
  3) Declare a int variable non_children_comics_count and assign a value of 0
  4) Find the count of non_children_comics by subtracting children_comics_count
     from total_comics_count
  5) Print the value of non_children_comics answer should be 74

  PART TWO
  ========
  6) In a sale 15 children comics were sold, so children comics count now decreases by 15.
     Use the subtraction operator like "x = x - some_value" and update
     variable children_comics_count to reflect the 15 sold children comics count
  7) Print the new value of variable children_comics_count

  PART THREE
  ==========
  8) There are 3 children comics that gets damaged during sale and gets trashed
     so children comics count decreases by 3 further.
     Use the -= decrement operator like "x -= some_value " and update
     variable children_comics_count
  9) Print the new decremented value of variable children_comics_count
