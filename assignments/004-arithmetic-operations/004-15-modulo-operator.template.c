/*
  UNDERSTANDING MODULO OPERATOR IN C - TOUR GROUP AND BISCUITS

  1) Declare a variable total_members_in_tour_group and assign a value of 8
  2) Declare a variable total_number_of_biscuits and assign a value of 42
  3) Declare a variable number_of_biscuits_after_equal_distribution and assign a value 0
  4) Calculate how many biscuits will remain undistibuted after equally distributing the 42 biscuits to
     8 tour group members, ensure no member gets more or lesser biscuits than other members
     hint: use the modulo operator %
  5) Store calculated value in number_of_biscuits_after_equal_distribution and print it,
     2 biscuits should remain
